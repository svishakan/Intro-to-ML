# Alzheimer's Disease Classification

A project that analyses two CNN based deep learning architectures for classifying the extent of Alzheimer's disease, given an MRI scan of the brain.

### Done By:
- Shashanka Venkatesh   (18 5001 145)
- Suraj Jain            (18 5001 177)
- Vishakan Subramanian  (18 5001 196)
- Vishnu Krishnan       (18 5001 200)

### Environment:
- Coded in Python 3.8
- Trained in a cloud runtime with a GPU in Kaggle.
- We recommend to use GPU accelerator for faster processing.

### Folders:
- Data      -   Contains the required dataset.
- Models    -   Contains the pretrained model files in HDF5 format.
- Notebooks -   Contains the code to train and visualise the models.
- Results   -   Contains the results obtained from our models.
- Report    -   Contains the project explanation and tabulation of results.

### Instructions:
- Run ```pip install numpy pandas seaborn tensorflow tensorflow-addons matplotlib Pillow sklearn keras``` to install the required dependencies.
- Put the dataset in the specified folder format as in the notebooks.
- Run the notebooks in an Interactive Python Notebook editor like Colab, Spyder, Jupyter Notebook.
- Alternatively, the pretrained models can be imported and used.
